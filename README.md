 My job throughout the internship was to determine the parameters of a star subclass called Gamma Doradus stars where I was given simulated frequency data for the corresponding stars and the corresponding parameters. In this repository, you will find attached the raw data as well as several different approaches on the raw data. These were coded on the Tensorflow library.
