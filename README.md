 My job throughout the internship was to determine the parameters of a star subclass called Gamma Doradus stars where I was given simulated frequency data for the corresponding stars and the corresponding parameters. In this repository, you will find attached the raw data as well as several different approaches on the raw data. These were coded on the Tensorflow library.
 
Note: There are processed frequency data files which are too large to be uploaded here. Therefore, they are attached in the Google Drive link here:
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/190Mvrx6QPo7SA_TWf2QRpfEuqm_16sRM?usp=sharing. Please download any one of the two files. One is in float format and the other in integer format depending on your system's storage

For the baseline models, I have taken the first 20000 points for training the model. Please feel free to change before running the file.
